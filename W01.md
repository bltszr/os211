# Top 10 List of Week 1
Disclaimer: This list is of no particular ordering, neither of importance nor chronological. It is written in the order in which I remembered them as I was writing this.
1. [InstallGentoo Wiki](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Main_Page)  
InstallGentoo Wiki is a wiki page on various technology-related topics, though more often than not related very specifically to GNU/Linux. It's a solid reference for various pastebins and resources for posts and generals made on [/g/](boards.4channel.org/g/), the parent site of which I grew up with and thus trust quite well on a subject such as this.
2. [Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/user/MentalOutlawStudios)  
Mental Outlaw is a YouTube channel focusing on topics of GNU/Linux covering introductory material for said topic as well as other miscellaneous subjects such as torrenting and privacy, including reviews of Linux distributions and occasionally tutorials on cooking good steaks. His channel also fairly popular among posters of /g/, which is why I've included him on this list.
3. [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA)  
Luke Smith is another YouTube channel that also focuses on topics around GNU/Linux and is as well fairly popular among posters of /g/, but for a somewhat different reason. Luke's videos in comparison to Mental Outlaw's are a step above in terms of the level of opinion that goes into them; in particular, Luke tends to have much more preconceived opinions when introducing his subscribers to subjects that he had been dealing with (in particular this can be seen in his videos concerning the FISH shell and groff, wherein he promotes both over other more mainstream options such as bash/zsh and Latex, respectively). As such Luke's popularity is not really derived from how educational he is, but from how opinionated he is, which mirrors the average /g/ poster -- and, to some extent, the average GNU/Linux user.
4. [The Gentoomen Library](https://archive.org/details/TheGentoomenLibrary)  
The Gentoomen Library is a library of around 30 gigabytes of book titles that concern approximately everything one could ever need on computers, compiled by the users of /g/. This also means that it includes a sizeable wealth of material that concerns almost every topic that one may touch on in the adventures of learning Operating Systems, the whole nine yards! Even if you don't like to read, the experience of simply sifting through these folders and just looking at how much information is implied to be stored by the titles alone is an enchantingly religious experience, in my humble opinion. The Gentoomen themselves are also still, allegedly, online [here](g.sicp.me).
