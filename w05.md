# Top 10 List of Week 05
This list is of no particular orderning, neither of importance nor chronological. It is written in the order in which I remembered them as I was writing this.

1. [Puppy Linux](https://puppylinux.com/)<br>
In one of this week's assignments was How Low Can You Go?, testing the physical limits of virtual memory allocation for Debian before kernel panic occurs.
While I was doing this, I remembered this little Linux distro, Puppy Linux.
It's a distro that lives entirely in memory, much like the Tails distro, but for performance purposes instead of security purposes.
I find it pretty cool because it can work quite well on machines with memory space as low as 128 MB, while using it for the actual OS itself.

2. [`vfork()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/vfork.2.html)<br>
This link provides documentation for the `vfork()` procedure mentioned in OSC chapter 10.
The segment on historic description and notes are quite interesting to me, because it gives a peek into ye olden days of computing where something had to be introduced just to address the evident problem of producing a copy of some process's address space if only reading or `exec()` occurs.
The notes part is also very interesting because it noted that `vfork()` can be implemented without an MMU which makes no sense and sounds like it requires wizardry.

3. [Implementing fork without MMU](https://sudonull.com/post/62976-Implementing-fork-without-MMU-Embox-Blog)<br>
Well it turns out, it was, in fact, wizardry.
This link covers the description of an implementation of `fork()` without an MMU on an embedded-intended RTOS, Embox.
And just as suspected, it's incredibly complicated (but also, really really cool).
So much so that reading it feels like reading ancient runes--though then again, half of the source code is in Cyrillic.

4. [slob, slab, slub of linux kernel](https://www.programmersought.com/article/11795979942/)<br>
This link gives a more in-depth top-down view the concept of slab, slob, and slub as discussed in OSC ch. 10, with high-level explanations followed by code examples for concrete context into what's going on.
The bulk of the article is a translation of one of the references listed below, which is in Mandarin that I unfortunately cannot read.
The article itself is a pretty interesting look into how (mostly) slab allocates/manages memory for kernel data structures.

5. [Prepaging and Applications to Array Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1674716)<br>
This paper looks into some prepaging algorithms and their performances on matrix calculations.
No comment, I can't even admit that I understand this paper at all, it's just really really cool to read.

6. [Using Vmstat to Monitor System Performance](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/use-vmstat-to-monitor-system-performance)<br>
This link explains the use of the `vmstat` command to monitor virtual memory usages and other related statistics.
That's it, that's all there is to it.

7. [Trapping Virtual Memory Acccess](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/windows-exploitation-tricks-trapping.html)<br>
This link explains a very real example of exploiting virtual memory TOCTOU vulnerability to basically do whatever, particularly during page fault resolution.
An interesting read, even if you're not a security person

8. [Braess Paradox](https://vcp.med.harvard.edu/braess-paradox.html)<br>
This link explains the phenomenon known as the Braess Paradox, that is, when road increase actually increases road congestion rather than decreasing it.
I think it's interesting because it's a literal real life depiction of Belamy's anomaly, one that occurs almost by natural design of human intuition.

9. [Physical Page Allocation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand009.html)<br>
This link explains the way Buddy allocation works in Linux.
I think it's interesting because I was wholly unaware that Knuth was involved in this, out of all people.

10. [What is NUMA?](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/vm/numa.html)<br>
This is an article from the Linux kernel team explaining NUMA.
Yea that's it, I can't actually understand things involving NUMA beyond this article, but it was pretty interesting nonetheless.

That's it for now. またね！
